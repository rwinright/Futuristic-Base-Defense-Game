# Game Dev Jam Submission

We used the following tools for the game: 
Phaser 3 - HTML 5 game development platform
Tiled Map Editor - Map creation
TexturePacker - Packaging sprites

### Running in Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
# or
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn run build
```

### Workflow

- Make changes to game files on designated branch
- Push to Dev branch for testing
- Push to Master for production
- For experimentation or otherwise, create branch off your own user branch
